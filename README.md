# Water Resource Management – Week 1 (ML Project)

This repository contains a **Machine Learning project** related to **Water Resource Management**.  
Currently, the notebook includes **data loading, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)** for the dataset.  
Future updates will add **ML model training and deployment**.

---

## 📌 Project Phases
✅ **Phase 1: Data Analysis & Cleaning (Completed)**
- Loaded dataset: cleaned_global_water_consumption.csv
- Checked:
  - Dataset shape & data types
  - Missing values
  - Duplicate rows
  - Summary statistics
- Outlier detection using **IQR method**
- Visualizations:
  - Correlation heatmap
  - Feature distributions (Histograms)
  - Boxplots for numeric features
- Saved cleaned dataset as cleaned_dataset_week1.csv

🔄 **Phase 2: ML Model Training (Coming Soon)**
- Planned models: **Linear Regression, Random Forest, or similar**
- Target: Predict water consumption trends or related metrics

🔄 **Phase 3: Model Deployment**
- Deploy as an interactive **web app** using **Streamlit** or **Flask**
